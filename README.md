# ðŸŒ³ Root Goal-Based Creating System â€“ Treeffiency

## Overview

This repository is the **Root** of _Treeffiency_.  
It serves as the **main navigation hub** and **entry point** to all other project modules.

- All functionality **requires Root**, and it is the foundation for the system.
- Most modules also **require Tree**, which powers the structural and data layer.
- _(Even Root itself depends on Tree for authentication!)_ Root is only a frontend.

## Core Responsibilities

- ðŸ”‘ **Accounts** â€“ Centralized login and unified session management across subdomains.
- ðŸ—‚ **Main Navigation** â€“ Directs users to every module in the ecosystem.
- ðŸŒ‰ **Integration Layer** â€“ Connects Tree with all other modules for smooth operation.

> Without Root, the rest of _Treeffiency_ cannot function.

## Dependencies

### Required

- **Tree** â†’ Provides the login/authentication endpoint and core data structure.

### Optional Enhancements

- Other branches (apps and modules) can be enabled once **Root + Tree** are active.
